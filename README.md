# eurofm
A Pure Data patch to modulate the frequency of any audio input


Features:
- Stereo inputs
- mod frequency
- mod depth
- mod offset

As it is an FM effect, it can also be used as an inline pitch LFO.

Based on example patch G09.pitchshifter.pd, made together with (well mostly by) Derek Holzer
